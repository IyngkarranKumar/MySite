Hi everyone, welcome to my page. 
As of 03/04/22 I'm still in the process of setting this up. So if things look messy... that's because they are!

### Who am I? ###

I'm a second year Physics and Computer Science student at Durham University. Since September I've been diving into [AI safety](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnT1xgZgkpk) and [Effective Altruism](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/). I'm generally pretty motivated to work on making sure that life on this planet plays its cards right and is on the path to reach the [huge future](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uD4izuDMUQA) that may await.
