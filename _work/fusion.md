#### **Nuclear Fusion**

I spent a lot of time in 2020 and 2021 exploring nuclear fusion. Creating a star on Earth seems to be a pretty cool thing to do, not to mention the abundant, mostly carbon-free energy that comes alongside. Below are some pieces of work that I put together during this time. 

(Feb 2021 - May 2021) 
The tokamak is the reactor design that looks to be the most promising approach to realising commercial fusion. I created a small webpage that discusses some of the engineering, physics and economics behind building this device - [Tokamak Webpage](https://master.dxu0ibbx1hi1j.amplifyapp.com/).

(June 2021 - August 2021)
I was lucky enough to intern at the Culham Centre for Fusion Energy in the summer of 2021. Working with the Toroidal Alfv√©n eigenmode team I analysed the stability of plasmas in the [JET tokamak](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00391-1), compiling a database to be used for further study. A fairly lengthy outline of the work is [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tEUlK8IfG75xfR8LaJvvVFu1dYcaMO0E/view?usp=sharing).
